## The Problem

AI and vibe coding made building products trivially easy — any founder can ship in a weekend. But **42% of startups still fail because they built something nobody needed** (CB Insights). The bottleneck shifted from execution to judgment: knowing *what* to build.

The best founders at top companies have always had an unfair advantage — armies of analysts, Big 4 consultants, and proprietary market intelligence costing $150K+. That's how they made better decisions: not better gut feelings, better data.

**Bulwark exists to end that asymmetry.**

## The Product

Bulwark Research is an AI-powered startup idea validator. A user describes their startup idea in plain language, and an autonomous **agent swarm** runs internet-scale research across 1,000+ data sources — delivering a structured intelligence brief to their inbox in ~30 minutes.

### What the Report Covers

| Dimension | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Market Sizing** | TAM, SAM, SOM with bottom-up and top-down modeling across 200+ industry databases |
| **Competitor Intel** | Internet-scale crawling — funding, hiring, product launches, positioning maps, moat analysis |
| **Business Model** | Revenue model stress-testing, unit economics simulation, pricing elasticity analysis |
| **Technical Feasibility** | Architecture complexity scoring, build-vs-buy analysis, infrastructure cost modeling |
| **Risk Assessment** | Multi-dimensional risk matrix — market, execution, regulatory, financial, competitive |
| **GTM Strategy** | Channel analysis, CAC modeling, launch sequence planning, growth lever identification |
| **Financial Projections** | 3-year P&L modeling, runway scenarios, funding requirement analysis, sensitivity tables |
| **Executive Summary** | Cross-agent synthesis with weighted confidence scoring and go/no-go recommendation |

### How It Works

1. **Input** — User describes their idea in plain language (no pitch deck required)
2. **Swarm** — Dozens of specialized AI agents fan out across the internet in parallel, each focused on one research dimension
3. **Deliver** — A synthesis engine cross-references findings, resolves conflicts, scores confidence, and delivers the report to the user's inbox in ~30 minutes. Also downloadable from the website anytime.

## Research Infrastructure

The agent swarm is powered by:

- **OpenAI / Anthropic** — LLMs for reasoning and analysis

## Pricing Model

Credit-based, no subscriptions. All paid plans are one-time purchases.

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|---|---|---|
| **Free** | $0 forever | 10 basic validations/month — market sizing, top 5 competitors, basic risk score, PDF export |
| **Pro** | $299 one-time | 10 deep research credits (never expire) — full agent swarm, Monte Carlo financials, GTM playbook, investor-ready reports |
| **Lifetime** | $599 one-time | 10 deep researches/month forever — everything in Pro + priority processing, white-label reports, dedicated support |

### Why Credits (Not Subscriptions)

- No subscription fatigue — users don't worry about cancelling
- $299 feels like a purchase, not a commitment (lower friction)
- Credits never expire — use on your own schedule
- Lifetime tier at $599 creates an anchor that makes $299 look like a bargain

- **Serial entrepreneurs** choosing between multiple concepts

## Positioning

> "We don't tell you what to build. We give you the intelligence to decide for yourself — with the same rigor a $150K consulting engagement would."

### Key Differentiators vs. ChatGPT

| ChatGPT | Bulwark |
|---|---|
| Single model's opinion | Swarm of specialized agents |
| General knowledge | Internet-scale real-time research |
| Conversational output | Structured 30+ page intelligence brief |
| No financial modeling | Monte Carlo simulations, sensitivity tables |
| No confidence scoring | Cross-referenced confidence scores with go/no-go recommendation |

## Core Thesis

In a world where everyone can build, the founders who win are the ones with the **conviction** to know they're building the right thing. Taste is the last moat — Bulwark gives you the data to back it up.
